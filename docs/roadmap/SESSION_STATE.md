| A1  | done | approved (Joel, 2026-07-03) | — | 47d7a55 | audit clean; 13 approved local literals + critical.css exempt (T3 ruling); A6a/C4 unblocked |
| A2  | done | n/a | — | 73ff143 | one store write/gesture proven by test; profiler + two-tab smoke deferred to A5 gate evidence |
| A3  | done | n/a | A2 | 37443fe | zero mid-gesture re-renders; NOTE: camera/update has NO server relay (pre-existing — see deferred) |
| A4  | done | n/a | — | d0891ed | T3 ruling: realized as ADDITIVE narrow-selector modules (src/stores/scene/) — gameStore.ts diff is ZERO; isolation via Immer structural sharing, proven by sliceIsolation.test.ts; physical monolith split deferred as optional cleanup. A5 imports from stores/scene/index.ts |
| A5  | done | approved | A4 | f149b92 | A3 soft-dep; NOTE: A4's narrow hooks are additive/dormant — A5 wires them into layer components (that's where the re-render win lands) |

| C1  | done | approved via T3 review w/ fixes required | C0(approved) | b22691e | services/asset-service; T3 REVIEW: service fails own tsc (404-handler types) + port-5001 default collision — see reviews/S3 must-fix #3/#4 |

Guests = localStorage only (Joel ruling) |

| B1  | done | approved via T3 review | B0 | b22691e | normalize.mjs deterministic (fixed generatedAt, sorted, hash ids, 10% residue abort) + verify.mjs double-run check; sample taxonomy review waived by Joel; improvements: canonical-dup ordering, richer tags — reviews/S3 #11/#12 |

## Open T3 rulings pending
(none)

## Deferred / unscheduled
- Token-vision fog (post-A9; product decision needed — see ADR-0009).
- Map/document drop routing from Atlas dock (C5 open_question: background-set + handout-share flows).
- Hover-peek for Atlas dock (C4 recommends click-only first).
- **Server camera/update relay** (found in A3): 'camera/update' is not in EntitySyncHandler
  RELAY_EVENTS — Follow-DM cross-client sync is broken end-to-end, pre-existing. Needs a small
  server packet: add relay + decide host-only enforcement (DM_ONLY precedent). Scout-Data's
  claim that EntitySyncHandler handles camera/* was WRONG.
- Transform-formula duplication: SceneCanvas declarative template + cameraGestureEngine
  imperative write compute the same string — extract shared helper in A10.
- PropRenderer still uses the pre-A2 mousemove drag pattern — candidate A2-style follow-up.
- Zoom-at-cursor does not exist (zoom is center-anchored) — potential UX packet.
- **Session recovery hangs forever** on "Loading game…" when the stored room is dead server-side;
  recovery uses an UNDOCUMENTED `nexus-room` cookie (plus localStorage nexus-session/
  nexus-connection-context + IndexedDB) that stuck pages re-write, making escape impossible
  without clearing the cookie. Chip filed (task_c85a53e7). Document cookie in CLAUDE.md (A10).
- Flaky pre-existing test: gameStore.test.ts token/move updatedAt toBeGreaterThan on
  same-millisecond timestamps. Chip filed (task_da58aa9c).
- vitest mockReset:true gotcha: vi.mock factory mockResolvedValue is wiped per-test; re-arm in
  beforeEach (see sliceIsolation.test.ts / gameStore.persistence.test.ts convention).

## Known drift (codebase facts that contradict older docs — trust these, fix docs in A10)
- CLAUDE.md §3/§11 claim canvas rendering → actually SVG master + DOM tokens (verified e29131b).
- CLAUDE.md says `src/utils/websocket.ts` → actually `src/services/websocket.ts`.
- CLAUDE.md references `drawingPersistenceV2.ts` and `'mask'` drawing type → neither exists.
- `server/index.ts` `routeMessage()` is dead code; live path = SocketManager + `server/socket/handlers/*`.
- No feature-flag infrastructure exists (A6a introduces it).

## Session log (append-only)
| date | session | packet | outcome | spend (approx, by tier) | notes |
|------|---------|--------|---------|--------------------------|-------|
| 2026-07-02 | S0 | roadmap bootstrap | done | T1 ~193k (3 scouts, prior session) · T2 ~187k (3 specialists, prior session) · T3 planning + this package | Blueprint + Roadmap Package created. Ground truth pinned @ e29131b. Next: A1 / C0 / C3 (any order, parallel-safe). |
| 2026-07-03 | S4 | fix-pack (S3 must-fixes #1-4 + #5/#8) | done | T2 155k (over informal ~80k estimate — thorough test work: 18 new tests incl. 9-test service supertest suite) · T3 review ~25k | Branch packet/fixpack-S3 → master. Security guard landed + verified line-by-line (mount at server/index.ts:1648). Joel ruling mid-flight: guests localStorage-only (ADR-0012 amendment). Root 455 tests + service 9/9 green, both tsc clean. C2 unblocked for UI exposure. Remaining from S3 review: should-fixes #9/#10/#14 + nice-to-haves → fold into C5/C6/B3 briefs. Next: C5 or A5; camera-relay chip still in flight. |
| 2026-07-03 | S3 | B0-B2, C1-C4 (executed by JOEL solo) + T3 review | done | Joel: human execution (no model spend) · T3 review pass ~40k | Commits b22691e/ac97cd2/77cfd67 direct to master. T3 review = docs/roadmap/reviews/S3-review-B1-B2-C2-C3-C4.md: B1/B2 PASS, C1 pass-w/-fixes (service fails own tsc; port collision), C2 BLOCKED for UI exposure (secret-injection hole + dead client path), C3/C4 pass-w/-gaps (no pagination/virtualization — C6 entry criteria; HTML5 DnD → C5 replaces per ADR-0008). ADR-0010/11/12 Accepted w/ Joel's picks; 0011 quotas synced to implementation; 0012 carries known-gap note. Next: fix-pack for must-fixes #1-4, then A5 or C5. |
| 2026-07-03 | S2 | A4+A6a (batched by Joel, parallel T2 builds) | done | A4: T2 109k (~under 180k cap) · A6a: T2 105k + T3 preview verification (~cap) | Branch packet/A4-A6a stacked on packet/A1-A3. A4 accepted via T3 ruling (additive, zero gameStore diff — exit criteria all met). A6a live-verified both flag states; T3 preview caught+fixed real grid blowout bug (minmax(0,1fr)). 446 tests passing. New findings: nexus-room cookie (undocumented persistence layer), dead-room recovery hang (chip filed), flaky gameStore test (chip filed). A6a gate PENDING Joel review. Next: A5 (unblocked), C0/C3; A6b/A7 blocked on A6a gate. |
| 2026-07-03 | S1 | A1+A2+A3 (batched by Joel) | done | A1: T0+T3 inline (~within cap) · A2: T2 172k (OVER 120k cap — builder hit lint-rule fights + found/fixed 2 real bugs; work complete, no split) · A3: T2 122k (~cap) · T3 review/verify throughout | Single branch packet/A1-A3 (deviation from branch-per-packet: Joel batched; per-packet commits preserved). Drift found: scout errors (DrawingTools inline z never existed; EntitySync does NOT relay camera/*). Baseline: database.test.ts fails pre-existing (needs live PostgreSQL). A1 gate PENDING Joel review. Exit-criteria deferrals: profiler trace + two-tab smoke need running backend — folded into A5's gate evidence per T3 ruling. Next: A4 (unblocked) or C0/C3; A6a/C4 blocked on A1 gate approval. |
| 2026-07-04 | S6 | A5, B3, A6b gate | done | T3 ~20k | Salvaged A5 and B3 uncommitted files (tests passed, dry run passed), committed. Prepared gate review for A5, A6b, B3. Next: Joel's gate review, then merge to master, then C5/A7/A8a. |
