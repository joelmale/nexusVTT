## Open T3 rulings pending
(none)

## Deferred / unscheduled
- Token-vision fog (post-A9; product decision needed — see ADR-0009).
- Map/document drop routing from Atlas dock (C5 open_question: background-set + handout-share flows).
- Hover-peek for Atlas dock (C4 recommends click-only first).
- **Server camera/update relay** (found in A3): 'camera/update' is not in EntitySyncHandler
  RELAY_EVENTS — Follow-DM cross-client sync is broken end-to-end, pre-existing. Needs a small
  server packet: add relay + decide host-only enforcement (DM_ONLY precedent). Scout-Data's
  claim that EntitySyncHandler handles camera/* was WRONG.
- Transform-formula duplication: SceneCanvas declarative template + cameraGestureEngine
  imperative write compute the same string — extract shared helper in A10.
- PropRenderer still uses the pre-A2 mousemove drag pattern — candidate A2-style follow-up.
- Zoom-at-cursor does not exist (zoom is center-anchored) — potential UX packet.

## Known drift (codebase facts that contradict older docs — trust these, fix docs in A10)
- CLAUDE.md §3/§11 claim canvas rendering → actually SVG master + DOM tokens (verified e29131b).
- CLAUDE.md says `src/utils/websocket.ts` → actually `src/services/websocket.ts`.
- CLAUDE.md references `drawingPersistenceV2.ts` and `'mask'` drawing type → neither exists.
- `server/index.ts` `routeMessage()` is dead code; live path = SocketManager + `server/socket/handlers/*`.
- No feature-flag infrastructure exists (A6a introduces it).

## Session log (append-only)
| date | session | packet | outcome | spend (approx, by tier) | notes |
|------|---------|--------|---------|--------------------------|-------|
| 2026-07-02 | S0 | roadmap bootstrap | done | T1 ~193k (3 scouts, prior session) · T2 ~187k (3 specialists, prior session) · T3 planning + this package | Blueprint + Roadmap Package created. Ground truth pinned @ e29131b. Next: A1 / C0 / C3 (any order, parallel-safe). |
| 2026-07-03 | S1 | A1+A2+A3 (batched by Joel) | done | A1: T0+T3 inline (~within cap) · A2: T2 172k (OVER 120k cap — builder hit lint-rule fights + found/fixed 2 real bugs; work complete, no split) · A3: T2 122k (~cap) · T3 review/verify throughout | Single branch packet/A1-A3 (deviation from branch-per-packet: Joel batched; per-packet commits preserved). Drift found: scout errors (DrawingTools inline z never existed; EntitySync does NOT relay camera/*). Baseline: database.test.ts fails pre-existing (needs live PostgreSQL). A1 gate PENDING Joel review. Exit-criteria deferrals: profiler trace + two-tab smoke need running backend — folded into A5's gate evidence per T3 ruling. Next: A4 (unblocked) or C0/C3; A6a/C4 blocked on A1 gate approval. |
